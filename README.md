# TandemCloneBackend
Back end for clone of Tandem web app written in Django REST Framework. Developed as final project for web development degree.

## Todo List
- [ ] Write base model, make adjustments as needed
- [ ] Reflect model adjustments on ER diagram
  - [ ] User model extends default Django user model, so its attributes and relationships must be added
  - [ ] "Group" model must be renamed "Channel" or something similar, to avoid confusion with user role groups.
- [ ] Write serializers
- [ ] Create Postman collection
- [ ] Write seeders
- [ ] Add more languages and interests (read them from a JSON file?)
